I created this app for people who are interested in languages. Here you can learn and practice different languages, through studying, and communicating with other users. Keep up the hard work.

Languages are fun. They allow you to get introduced to other cultures and learn more about as many topics as you could imagine. I advice you to stay commited and enthusiastic.


**My daily Journal**

I think I need to develop my planning skills and make better use of my time. So far, I've learned many things, but I'm not fully satisfied with what I learned, I do practice and apply what I learn, but I'd like to manage my time so that I could study from the text books as well. I believe this is a bit confusing in the beginning but I'm sure I'll get used to it soon. I will evaluate my learning journey every day and write down the things excelled at and the things I need to enhance. 

**My answers to the questions**

This lab went quite alright.  I learned some interesting stuff and got more used to using Ubuntu and VS code. It took me like hours working on this lab. At first, I thought I would complete it in two hours but apparently, it took a longer time.
